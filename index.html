        <p>Hello, random stranger that has managed 
        to get here. Welcome to the place where I put random files.
        I am a rather basic coder with a knowledge of most html code
        and pretty much nothing else. I go by the online code name 
        of Duskie. There is a history to the name that is a few 
        sentences long and probably should not be put here, but I'm
        going to do it anyways. Some of you may know the series 
        called 'Warriors' by Erin Hunter. The OC that I have created
        as my own character derived from Warriors is Duskwater. 
        Duskwater. Dusk. Duskie. So, that is the take of how my 
        name was created. I am an avid Wattpadder who goes by the 
        username of 'helloilovecats' I am currently attending an 
        8-week course in Computer Science and this is what has 
        prompted me to make a C9 account. I will be using this page
        to, as my teacher puts it, "show off my work." Alright, 
        that's it for this rather long intro. Stay tuned and watch 
        for <i>interesting</i> things that may come up later on 
        this website.</p>
